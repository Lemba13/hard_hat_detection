## Description
Detecting whether a person is wearing a hard hat or not using yolov3. The dataset used is from kaggle. The link to the dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/hard-hat-detection). The model was built from scratch in pytorch following this [tutorial](https://github.com/aladdinpersson/Machine-Learning-Collection/tree/master/ML/Pytorch/object_detection/YOLOv3).
